Process Documentation

This section outlines the process our group followed to develop the Base Converter application, from planning and role assignment to the tools and methodologies we used.

1.1 Project Overview and Objectives

Our primary goal was to develop a simple, intuitive, and efficient mobile application for converting numbers between different bases. We focused on the most commonly used bases in computing: Binary (Base 2), Octal (Base 8), Decimal (Base 10), and Hexadecimal (Base 16). The project was designed to be a practical exercise in mobile development with Flutter, focusing on clean architecture, user interface design, and state management.

1.2 Team Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure a smooth workflow and clear accountability, we assigned the following roles to our five members:
Member Name	Role	Responsibilities
CT100/G/22688/24-	Project Lead & Documentation	- Coordinated the project timeline and tasks. - Ensured clear communication within the team. - Wrote and compiled the final project documentation.
CT100/G/21350/24-Lead Logic Developer	- Designed and implemented the core ConversionService class. - Wrote the algorithms for base conversions. - Handled numerical data logic, including using BigInt.
CT100/G/22452/24-	UI/UX Frontend Developer	- Designed the application's layout and user interface. - Implemented the Flutter widgets (TextField, DropdownButton, etc.). - Focused on styling and user experience.
CT100/G/22010/24-	State & Integration Engineer	- Connected the UI to the conversion logic. - Managed the application's state within the _NumberConverterScreenState class. - Implemented the _performConversion function and error handling.
CT100/G/15899/22	Quality Assurance & Tester	- Performed thorough testing of the application. - Identified and reported bugs (e.g., input validation errors, UI glitches). - Ensured the final product met our objectives.

1.3 Development Methodology

We adopted a simplified Agile methodology for this project. Our process involved:

    Planning: We started by defining the core features and requirements for the app.

    Design: We created a simple wireframe for the UI to guide the development process.

    Development Sprints: We broke the work into two main sprints.

        Sprint 1: Focused on developing the core conversion logic (ConversionService).

        Sprint 2: Focused on building the Flutter UI and integrating it with the logic.

    Testing & Review: After each sprint, we tested the implemented features and reviewed the code as a team.

    Finalization: We conducted final testing and prepared the documentation.

1.4 Tools and Technologies

    Programming Language: Dart

    Framework: Flutter SDK

    IDE: Visual Studio Code

    Version Control: Git & GitHub for collaboration and source code management.
